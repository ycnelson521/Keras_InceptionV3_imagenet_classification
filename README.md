# Keras_InceptionV3_imagenet_classification
An example of using a separate InceptionV3 network with pretrained imagenet weights using Keras.\
The InceptionV3 implementation were modified from  Keras/applications/inception_V3.py by fchollet.\
Note only prediction was implemented.

## Dependencies:
Tensorflow >= 1.3.0 \
Keras >= 2.1.5

## Usage:
python main.py -i images/eagle.jpg

## Worked on:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / GTX 750Ti + 2GB memory for both python2 and python3\
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS / GT 940M + 4GB memory for both python2 and python3
